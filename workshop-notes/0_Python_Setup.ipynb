This workshop targets beginner Python programmers already familiar with the fundamentals.\n","\n","Throughout this interactive workshop, you will apply these concepts to solve mini biology-themed challenges using Python 3, and begin a larger guided programming challenge that can be completed and/or further refined after the live session.\n","\n","**Note that this course will address the use of the Python language itself and relevant programming concepts, and will not cover installation, data cleaning and preprocessing, or discuss any specific libraries in detail.**\n","\n","Prior to the workshop, participants must have Python 3+ and a code editor of their choice (e.g. VSCode, Atom, PyCharm) installed, set up, and tested on their computers. Alternatively, participants may create a Jupyter Notebook on Google Collab to participate through their web browser. \n","\n","**These Jupyter notebookes function as workshop notes that you can reference both during and after the workshop.**\n","\n","## Pre-requisites and Pre-assessment\n","\n","You should already be familiar with basic programming in Python (variables, lists, loops, functions, conditional statements, printing to console, basic string manipulation), and have written at least a few small scripts from scratch. Knowledge of these fundamentals will be assumed, thus participants should review these topics beforehand if necessary.\n","\n","It is highly recommended that you complete the online pre-assessment coding challenge, before the workshop start date. This will help brush-up on basic Python skills, and code snippets from the solutions may be useful during the workshop.\n","\n","The pre-assessment challenge can be accessed here: https://www.hackerrank.com/python-workshop-pre-assessment-challenge-winter-2021\n","\n","You will need to create a HackerRank account if you do not already have one (free) to submit solutions.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JKnqWvMdRJex"},"source":["---\n","\n","## Outline\n","*Note that intermediate times are approximate.*\n","\n","###Part 1 (1:00pm - 3:00pm):\n","1.   **Introduction** (10 min)\n","2.   **Object Oriented Programming** (1 hour)\n","     * Basics: Classes, attribute types, method types\n","     * ```@property``` decorator, magic methods\n","     * Inheritance\n","3.   **Exception Handling** (50 min)\n","\n","###Break (3:00pm - 3:30pm)\n","\n","###Part 2 (3:30pm - 5:00pm):\n","1.   **Recursion** (30 min)\n","2.   **Reading and writing files** (30 min)\n","3.   **Final Challenge** (30 min)\n","\n","\n","### Workshop Links & Resources\n","\n","*   **GitHub Link:** https://github.com/EishaAA/Python-Workshop-Winter-2021\n","*   **Live Poll:** https://app.sli.do/event/kquj6xd5"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b-zi8BB7x-p0"},"source":["---\n","\n","##Getting Setup\n","\n","By now, you should already have Python 3 running on your computer, using the IDE of your choice.
