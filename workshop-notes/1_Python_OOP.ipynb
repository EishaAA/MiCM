However, larger projects can quickly become a nightmare!\n","\n","**Object oriented programming (OOP)** is a way to write and structure programs that allows us to logically group our data and functions for better code organization and reuse.\n","\n","OOP is based around the concept of **objects**, which are a collection of data and associated functions. This model common and applicable to many modern programming languages (e.g. Java, C++).\n","\n","### **Objects and Classes**\n","\n","When our **variables** and **functions** are organized into units called objects, they are called **attributes** and **methods** respectively.\n","\n","You can think of a **class** as an object blueprint, which includes details like what data an object should have and what it should do. This can significantly improve code reusability!\n","\n","### **Objects and Classes in Python**\n","\n","In Python, every value is an object! For example, Python has a built-in `string` class:\n","\n","* ```myString = 'hello there'``` instantiates a new object of type string\n","* Built-in methods are exposed for the at object, e.g. `lower()`, `join()`\n","\n","Classes are templates for creating objects, and define a 'type'.
