# MiCM Workshop: Python - Beyond the Basics (Winter 2021)

## Workshop Overview
Python is a general-purpose language popular in data science, machine learning, and computational biology. This workshop targets beginner Python programmers already familiar with the fundamentals.

Throughout this interactive workshop, you will apply these concepts to solve mini biology-themed challenges using Python 3, and begin a larger guided programming challenge that can be completed and/or further refined after the live session.

**Note that this course will address the use of the Python language itself and relevant programming concepts, and will not cover installation, data cleaning and preprocessing, or discuss any specific libraries in detail.**

Prior to the workshop, participants must have Python 3+ and a code editor of their choice (e.g. VSCode, Atom, PyCharm) installed, set up, and tested on their computers. Alternatively, participants may create a Jupyter Notebook on Google Collab to participate through their web browser. 

This repository contains workshop notes (Jupyter Notebooks) with annotations and code references used during the live demos, as well as a processed dataset from STRING-db to be used for the final workshop challenge.


## Pre-requisites and Pre-assessment

You should already be familiar with basic programming in Python (variables, lists, loops, functions, conditional statements, printing to console, basic string manipulation), and have written at least a few small scripts from scratch. Knowledge of these fundamentals will be assumed, thus participants should review these topics beforehand if necessary.

It is highly recommended that you complete the online pre-assessment coding challenge, before the workshop start date. This will help brush-up on basic Python skills, and code snippets from the solutions may be useful during the workshop.

The pre-assessment challenge can be accessed here: https://www.hackerrank.com/python-workshop-pre-assessment-challenge-winter-2021

You will need to create a HackerRank account if you do not already have one (free) to submit solutions.
