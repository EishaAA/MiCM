# MiCM Workshop: Python - Beyond the Basics (Winter 2021)

## Workshop Overview
Python is a general-purpose language popular in data science, machine learning, and computational biology. This workshop targets beginner Python programmers already familiar with the fundamentals.

Throughout this interactive workshop, you will apply these concepts to solve mini biology-themed challenges using Python 3, and begin a larger guided programming challenge that can be completed and/or further refined after the live session.

**Note that this course will address the use of the Python language itself and relevant programming concepts, and will not cover installation, data cleaning and preprocessing, or discuss any specific libraries in detail.**

Prior to the workshop, participants must have Python 3+ and a code editor of their choice (e.g. VSCode, Atom, PyCharm) installed, set up, and tested on their computers. Alternatively, participants may create a Jupyter Notebook on Google Collab to participate through their web browser. 

This repository contains workshop notes (Jupyter Notebooks) with annotations and code references used during the live demos, as well as a processed dataset from STRING-db to be used for the final workshop challenge.
